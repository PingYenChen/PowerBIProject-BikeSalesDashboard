# PowerBIProject-BikeSalesDashboard

The dataset and dashboard design is entirely credited to Udemy Course:Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/), instructed by Mavan Analytic and Chris Dutton. This is the course I enrolled for learning Power BI Desktop. Highly recommend to anyone interested in learning Power BI.

The dashboard design is to assist the Adventure Works (a bike company) to monitor order, revenue and return decomposed by each product, customer and also changes over time.

## Steps involved in building dashboard
1. Loaded all the tables into power bi, renamed tables as either lookup tables or data table based on the table informtation. 

2. Added columns & measures as required for analysis purpose.

3. Built model relationships between lookup and data tables. One unique key(lookup table) to many duplicate keys(data table) rules applied.
